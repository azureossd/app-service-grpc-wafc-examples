Examples using gRPC servers on Azure Web Apps for Containers. 

To access these gRPC services, use tools like the below:

- [grpcui](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcui#grpc-ui) - GUI based
- [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl#grpcurl) - CLI based
- [BloomRPC](https://github.com/bloomrpc/bloomrpc) - GUI based
- [Insomnia](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/grpc) - GUI based
- [Postman](https://blog.postman.com/postman-v10-and-grpc-what-you-can-do/) - GUI based

**IMPORTANT**: gRPC is currently in public review for App Services. This is an experimental approach to run various stacks with gRPC on App Service in its current implementation.

For full gRPC support without the need for an HTTP server, use [Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/overview).
